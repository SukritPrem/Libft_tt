# Libft_tt
I have been learning about various concepts, including string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked lists.

String Manipulation:
Functions like ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_strncpy, ft_strcat, ft_strncat, ft_strcmp, etc.,

which perform operations on strings.
Involves operations on strings, which are sequences of characters. Common string manipulations include finding the length of a string (strlen), copying strings (strcpy, strncpy), concatenating strings (strcat, strncat), and comparing strings (strcmp, strncmp).

Memory Allocation:
Functions like ft_memset, ft_bzero, ft_memcpy, ft_memccpy, ft_memmove, ft_memchr etc., which handle memory operations.

String Conversion:
Functions like ft_atoi, ft_itoa, which convert strings to integers.

Character Classification:
Functions like ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, ft_isascii, ft_isprint, which check character types.

List Manipulation:
Functions like ft_lstnew, ft_lstdelone, ft_lstdel, ft_lstadd, ft_lstiter, ft_lstmap, which handle linked lists.

A data structure that consists of nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence. In the libft project, you might implement functions for creating a new node (ft_lstnew), deleting a node (ft_lstdelone), deleting an entire list (ft_lstdel), adding a new node to the list (ft_lstadd), iterating through the list (ft_lstiter), and mapping a function to each node in the list (ft_lstmap).
